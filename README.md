## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health indicators. This involves:
1.  **Basic Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
2.  **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for predicting diabetes.
3.  **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implementing and evaluating common classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset**. You will need to download this dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

* **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset
* **File:** `diabetes_risk_prediction_dataset.csv`

## Key Features

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling inconsistencies and missing data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distributions and relationships.
* **Feature Engineering (Optional, but good for learning):** Creating new features from existing ones.
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Understanding which factors contribute most to diabetes risk.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Applying various ML models and comparing their performance.

## Tools Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and model selection.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **SQL (Optional/Future Enhancement):** For potential integration with databases, though not directly used in the core ML pipeline for this beginner project. This is more of a skill you'll learn to apply.
